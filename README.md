# HOKM-scorekeeper
Scorekeeper for Eastern card game Hokm. With a twist....BIDS?!!
This is a scorekeeper for the pursian card game Hokm. The twist from the 
original card game is that in this version, you have bids to make it more
interesting. This was written in React.js as a first project and therefore hasnt 
been done with components.

This software was made with the intent of sabotaging iSAMS school systems. Please contribute via Western Uion: jhenry2491@gmail.com
